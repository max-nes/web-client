# web-client

TokenD client application.

Known issues: 

* Some tests are forcing `Vue.config.silent` flag because of a few annoying
warnings, (https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils/issues/532). Remove once
migrating to Vue 2.6
* `documents` module and all it's internals are in draft, may not be released and may not be compatible with other TokenD features.
